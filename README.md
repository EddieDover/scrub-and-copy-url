# Scrub & Copy URL - A Chrome Extension

I created this extension just because I was tired of visiting pages where links to Amazon products were a mangled heap of tracking data and referrals.

This extension will let you rightclick on a link that contans a URL like: https://somenewssite/?ref=referral-tracking-d&actual_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct%2F%3Ftag%3Dsleazyreferralid

Select Copy Scrubbed URL and your clipboard is filled with: https://www.amazon.com/product/

## Publishing the Extension

One day when I've used it enough, tweaked it enough, and am happy that it performs in a decent manner on most sites, I'll publish it.  Until then, just download the ZIP and install it by hand.
